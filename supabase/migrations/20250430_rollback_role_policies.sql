-- The simplest solution: just disable RLS on all tables
-- This will give full access to all tables without any restrictions
-- We can re-implement proper RLS later when we have time to test it thoroughly

-- Keep RLS disabled on all tables
-- This was done at the beginning of the script

-- Drop any existing policies to avoid conflicts
