# Supabase Authentication Issues - Debugging and Resolution

## Problem Identification

Despite valid authentication tokens being present in the cookies, the Supabase SSR client is unable to hydrate a session, resulting in:

1. Users being redirected to the sign-in page despite having valid tokens
2. `getSession()` calls returning `{ session: null, error: null }`
3. Authentication state not persisting between page refreshes

## Root Cause Analysis

The primary issue occurs because the Supabase SSR client (`@supabase/ssr@0.6.1`) is not able to properly read cookies and establish a valid session. This is likely due to one or more of the following:

1. **Cookie Format Mismatch**: The Supabase client expects cookies in a specific format that might not match how they're being provided
2. **SSR Client Configuration**: With recent versions of `@supabase/ssr`, the cookie API changed from using `get`/`set`/`remove` to `getAll`/`setAll`
3. **Token Processing**: The tokens may not be properly extracted or processed by the middleware client
4. **Cookie Middleware Interface**: Inconsistencies between cookie interfaces in different parts of the application

## Diagnostic Findings

- Cookies for access token and refresh token are present and valid
- Access token JWT is well-formed and not expired
- `getSession()` still returns null despite valid tokens
- Multiple token formats present: standard tokens (`access-token`, `refresh-token`) and legacy format (`auth-token`)

## Action Plan

### 1. Standardize Supabase SSR Cookie Management

- Ensure all cookie management uses the proper interface for `@supabase/ssr@0.6.1`:
  - Use `getAll` and `setAll` only (no individual `get`/`set` methods)
  - Ensure cookies are properly formatted according to SSR API requirements

### 2. Fix Token Extraction Logic

- Implement a consistent approach to extracting tokens from cookies
- Ensure cookie format is normalized across all middleware and API routes
- Add debug logging to track cookie and token flow throughout the authentication process

### 3. Address Potential Cookie Issues

- Check for conflicts with cookie path, domain, and SameSite settings
- Ensure HttpOnly and Secure flags are appropriately set based on environment
- Verify cookies are being sent with all requests to protected routes

### 4. Implement Better Error Handling and Diagnostics

- Add comprehensive logging around authentication flows
- Create debug endpoints to inspect token and session status
- Implement token refresh logic to handle expiring tokens

### 5. Clean Up Dependencies

- Ensure no conflicting or outdated authentication libraries are being used
- Standardize on the latest Supabase Auth library versions
- Remove any legacy authentication code that could interfere

## Implementation Steps

1. Update middleware client cookie handling:
   ```typescript
   const supabase = createSupabaseServerClient(url, key, {
     cookies: {
       getAll() {
         return Array.from(cookieStore.getAll()).map(({ name, value }) => ({ name, value }));
       },
       setAll(cookies) {
         cookies.forEach(({ name, value, options }) => {
           response.cookies.set({
             name,
             value,
             path: options?.path || '/',
             maxAge: options?.maxAge,
             // additional cookie options...
           });
         });
       }
     }
   });
   ```

2. Add deep debug logging for cookie inspection and token validation

3. Test authentication flow with full token lifecycle:
   - Login
   - Session validation
   - Token refresh
   - Logout

4. Use the new debug endpoint `/api/auth/debug` to inspect all relevant cookies and the current session state. This endpoint returns a JSON object with all cookies and the result of `getSession()`, which is useful for live diagnostics and debugging.

4. Implement a seamless token migration strategy for any existing users with legacy tokens. After migrating, the legacy `auth-token` cookie is now removed to prevent confusion and ensure only the new standard cookies are used.
