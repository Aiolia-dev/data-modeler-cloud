1. DDoS Protection Strategy
Infrastructure-Level Protection
Implement Cloudflare or similar CDN: Deploy a CDN with built-in DDoS protection
Rate Limiting: Configure rate limiting at the infrastructure level
Load Balancing: Distribute traffic across multiple servers to mitigate impact
Traffic Analysis: Implement real-time traffic monitoring to detect unusual patterns
Application-Level Protection
API Rate Limiting: Add rate limiting middleware for all API endpoints
Request Throttling: Implement progressive throttling for suspicious IP addresses
Caching Strategy: Optimize caching to reduce server load during traffic spikes
2. SQL Injection Prevention
Database Access Layer Hardening
Parameterized Queries: Ensure all database queries use parameterization
ORM Review: Audit how Supabase is being used to ensure proper query sanitization
Database Permissions: Review and restrict database user permissions to minimum required
Input Validation & Sanitization
Client-Side Validation: Enhance form validation for all user inputs
Server-Side Validation: Implement comprehensive server-side validation as the primary defense
Content Security Policy: Implement strict CSP headers to prevent XSS attacks that could lead to injection
3. Authentication & Authorization Enhancements
Authentication Hardening
Multi-Factor Authentication: Implement MFA for all user accounts (Done already)
Password Policies: Enforce strong password requirements (Done already)
Session Management: Implement secure session handling with proper timeout and rotation
JWT Security: Review JWT implementation for proper signing and validation
Authorization Improvements
Role-Based Access Control Audit: Review and enhance the existing RBAC system
Permission Granularity: Increase granularity of permissions for finer control
API Authorization: Ensure every API endpoint has proper authorization checks
4. Data Protection Measures
Encryption Strategy
Data-at-Rest Encryption: Implement encryption for all sensitive data stored in the database
Data-in-Transit Encryption: Ensure all communications use TLS 1.3
Key Management: Implement secure key management practices
Data Access Controls
Data Masking: Implement data masking for sensitive information
Audit Logging: Track all data access and modifications
Data Classification: Classify data by sensitivity and apply appropriate controls
5. Infrastructure Security
Network Security
Web Application Firewall: Implement a WAF to filter malicious traffic
Network Segmentation: Isolate database servers from public networks
IP Whitelisting: Consider IP whitelisting for admin functions
Monitoring & Incident Response
Security Monitoring: Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring
Intrusion Detection: Deploy IDS/IPS systems to detect and block attacks
Incident Response Plan: Develop a formal incident response procedure
6. Security Testing & Validation
Penetration Testing
Regular Penetration Testing: Schedule regular penetration tests
Vulnerability Scanning: Implement automated vulnerability scanning
Code Security Reviews: Conduct regular security-focused code reviews
Compliance & Best Practices
OWASP Compliance: Ensure compliance with OWASP Top 10 security risks
Security Headers: Implement all recommended security headers
Dependency Scanning: Regularly scan and update dependencies for security vulnerabilities
