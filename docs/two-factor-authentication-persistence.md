# Two-Factor Authentication Persistence Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) persistence in the Data Modeler Cloud application, focusing on ensuring 2FA settings remain active even after clearing the browser's cache.

## Problem Statement

Previously, when a user enabled 2FA and then cleared their browser's cache, the 2FA settings would be lost. This occurred because:

1. The 2FA settings were primarily stored in the browser's local storage
2. The Supabase user metadata was not being properly updated with the 2FA status
3. The application wasn't explicitly setting the `two_factor_enabled` flag in the user metadata
4. Cookie parsing errors were causing authentication session issues
5. False positives were occurring in the 2FA status detection

## Implementation Solution

We've implemented a robust solution that ensures 2FA settings persist by:

1. **Dual Storage Strategy**: Storing 2FA settings in both Supabase user metadata (primary) and local storage (fallback)
2. **Metadata Prioritization**: Always prioritizing Supabase user metadata over local storage when checking 2FA status
3. **Automatic Synchronization**: Automatically synchronizing local storage settings to Supabase metadata when discrepancies are detected
4. **Temporary Key Cleanup**: Automatically cleaning up temporary 2FA keys to prevent false positives
5. **Improved Authentication Resilience**: Better handling of authentication session issues

### Key Changes

1. **In the `verifyTwoFactor` function**:
   - Explicitly set `two_factor_enabled: true` in the Supabase user metadata when enabling 2FA
   - Store the TOTP secret in both Supabase metadata and local storage for redundancy

2. **In the `validateTwoFactorToken` function**:
   - Prioritize Supabase metadata over local storage when validating tokens
   - Automatically update Supabase metadata if using local storage as a fallback

3. **In the `initAuth` function**:
   - Check for 2FA status in both Supabase metadata and local storage
   - Update Supabase metadata with local storage settings if discrepancies are detected

4. **In the sign-in process**:
   - Prioritize Supabase metadata over local storage when checking if 2FA is enabled
   - Provide detailed logging for debugging 2FA status issues

5. **In the settings page**:
   - Improved 2FA status detection to prevent false positives
   - Added cleanup for temporary 2FA keys in localStorage
   - Only trust 2FA status from valid user objects

6. **In the auth context**:
   - Fixed cookie parsing issues by updating Supabase package versions
   - Added proper TypeScript typing to prevent errors
   - Improved error handling for authentication session issues

## Technical Implementation Details

### User Metadata Structure

When 2FA is enabled, the following fields are stored in the Supabase user metadata:

```json
{
  "totp_secret": "BASE32_ENCODED_SECRET",
  "two_factor_enabled": true,
  "totp_setup_time": "ISO_TIMESTAMP"
}
```

### LocalStorage Structure

For redundancy and fallback purposes, the following keys are stored in localStorage:

```
dm_two_factor_enabled_${userId}: "true" or "false"
dm_totp_secret_${userId}: "BASE32_ENCODED_SECRET"
```

### Temporary Keys

During the 2FA setup process, temporary keys may be created with the following pattern:

```
dm_pending_totp_secret_${userId}: "BASE32_ENCODED_SECRET"
dm_two_factor_enabled_temp_${hash}: "true"
```

These temporary keys are cleaned up after the 2FA setup process is complete or when they're detected during authentication.

### Local Storage Keys

For redundancy, the following keys are used in local storage:

- `dm_totp_secret_${userId}`: Stores the TOTP secret
- `dm_two_factor_enabled_${userId}`: Stores the 2FA enabled status ("true" or "false")

### Authentication Flow with 2FA

1. User enters email and password
2. Application checks if 2FA is enabled in Supabase metadata (primary) or local storage (fallback)
3. If 2FA is enabled, user is prompted to enter a verification code
4. Code is validated against the TOTP secret from Supabase metadata or local storage
5. If validation succeeds, user is granted access

## Security Considerations

- The TOTP secret is stored in Supabase user metadata, which is encrypted at rest
- Local storage is used only as a fallback mechanism
- The application attempts to synchronize local storage with Supabase metadata whenever possible
- Time drift is handled with a validation window to ensure codes remain valid

## Future Improvements

- Implement recovery codes for account recovery if the authenticator app is lost
- Add the ability to reset 2FA if access is lost
- Consider server-side validation of TOTP codes for enhanced security
